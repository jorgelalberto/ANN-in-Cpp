Vector.cpp
- Vector not array becuse it stores elements contigously, ow array would have cache misses therefore less effcient
- size_t is unsigned integer with no upper bound, size of it is determined by the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated in your system

Matrix.cpp
- Matrix is a 2D array of vectors, so typically we use two vectors to represent a matrix, but this has bad cache performance
- So we use a single vector to represent a matrix, and we use a function to access the elements of the matrix to allow for contigous memory access

WeightMatrix.cpp
- Has bias an weight matrix

ActivationFunction.cpp
- Need dynamic bidning, therefore need abstract classes and virtual functions
