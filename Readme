# History
- Bjarne Stroustrup invented C++ in 1979 at Bell Labs (ppl who made the first transistor)
- C++ stands for "C with classes"

# General C++ Knowledge
- Compiled language
![alt text](./imgs/compiled_vs_interpreted.png)
- Assignment Operator vs Copy Constructor
    - assignment operator: takes in already initialized object
    - copy constructor: takes in uninitialized object
- Const specifications
    - foo(const int x) {return x}: parameter passed in cannot be changed
    - const foo(int x) {return x}: function can only be called on a constant object
    - foo(int x) const {return x}: return type will be const int

# Files
## Vector.cpp
- Vector not array becuse it stores elements contigously, ow array would have cache misses therefore less effcient
- size_t is unsigned integer with no upper bound, size of it is determined by the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated in your system

## Matrix.cpp
- Matrix is a 2D array of vectors, so typically we use two vectors to represent a matrix, but this has bad cache performance
- So we use a single vector to represent a matrix, and we use a function to access the elements of the matrix to allow for contigous memory access

## WeightMatrix.cpp
- Has bias an weight matrix

## ActivationFunction.cpp
- Need dynamic bidning, therefore need abstract classes and virtual functions
